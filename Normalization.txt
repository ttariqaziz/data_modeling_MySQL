Normalization is a process used in relational database design to organize and structure data in a way that minimizes redundancy, reduces anomalies, and maintains data integrity. It involves dividing a database into smaller, related tables and establishing relationships between those tables.
------------------------------
Normalization(1st Normal Form):-
------------------------------
Department = #DEPT_ID + DEPT_NAME

Employee = # EMPLOYEE_NO  +  FIRST_NAME + LAST_NAME  +  DEPT_ID +  LOC_ID  +  MANAGER_ID  +  POSTION  +  STATUS  +  SALARY  +  COMMISSION_PCT  + DOB

Location = #LOCATION_ID  +  CITY  +  STATE + COUNTRY

Communication = #EMPLOYEE_NO  +  TYPE  +  DATA

Family = # EMPLOYEE_NO  +  FAMILY_NO + MEMBER  + LAST_NAME + FIRST_NAME + GENDER + DOB

------------------------------
Normalization(2nd Normal Form):-
------------------------------
2NF eliminates partial dependencies, where non-key attributes depend on only part of the primary key. This is usually achieved by breaking down a table into multiple related tables, each with a unique primary key.

Communication = #EMPLOYEE_NO  +  TYPE  +  DATA

Family = # EMPLOYEE_NO  +  FAMILY_NO + MEMBER  + LAST_NAME + FIRST_NAME + GENDER + DOB
Time = #EMPLOYEE_NO  +  DATE + HOURS
